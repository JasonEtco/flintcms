# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flint!

## Getting up and Running

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you are making changes to the admin dashboard, you'll need to add the `BUILD_DASHBOARD` variable to your `.env` file.

```
BUILD_DASHBOARD=true
```

Once that's done, you can go ahead and run:

```bash
npm start
```

Please discuss code changes before proposing a pull request by opening up an issue (especially if it's a new feature).

### 🎉 Emojis 🍆

Using emojis in commit messages is more than allowed, it's encouraged. They are fun and in many cases informative. That being said, there are some guidelines:
* Please only use one emoji and at the beginning of your commit message.
* If you do choose to put an emoji in a commit message, please do make sure that it has some kind of connection to the changes being proposed.

An example of a well-written commit message using an emoji:

```bash
👷 Add Travis-CI support
```
